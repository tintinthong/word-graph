## Description 

This is a psychology experiment design. This is a psychology experiment inspired by Hugo Blasdel's ideas. 

In this experiment, raters rate words based on a context. For example, rate "headquarters" in the  context of "dangerous". 
The rater assigns a number to represent how dangerous the word headquareters is. This eventually will place different words at 
different places on the scale -- creating a visualisation or word graph.

The novel aspect about this experiment is that a rater can re-rate words. By observing the word graph, a rater can consider relative of the current word with a previously rated word. He or she can change the previous rating by dragging the word to a different rating on the graph.
